# Welcome to HackYourFuture!

Hi teacher, welcome to HackYourFuture! In this document, you'll find all the instructions you need in order to prepare yourself for your upcoming journey in HackYourFuture, and beyond!

## Agenda

The course HTML/CSS has multiple goals. For one it's to get a good understanding of html/css but also to kickstart the group in terms of collaboration between students, feeling comfortable giving feedback and working together.

The course is structured in 3 classes, the individual lesson plans can be found in the corresponding weeks ( 1,2 and 3 **SHOULD HAVE LINKS**). What follows is an unordered list of teaching methods which have proven to be effective and might help your class to be as successful as possible. If you see other methods working well, please feel free to send in a pull request and amend/change the list.

### Methods

- In general, some students will already have some understanding of the concepts you are going to explain. It worked well to, before you explain anything, ask in the class if someone knows how it works.

  Even if you hear the correct answer in the first run, hear out other answers ( in the beginning you might have to ask the class for other answers ). The goal is to create a discourse in class, ideally even a debate between students. After the debate is over, reiterate what you have heard and explain how it actually works. You might even want to explain it if the correct answer was already said by one of the students to make sure that everyone heard it well and to capture it by your microphone when you do a screen recording.

- In your class groups will naturally form. This is good, but it is even better if the whole class is very comfortable working together. You can facilitate this by shuffling seating positions or when there is group work, randomly create the groups.

  If you do group work in class another method is to make them ask questions to their neighboring groups first before they can ask a teacher. The same could apply for question arising at home, first ask in the @general channel before asking a teacher directly.
