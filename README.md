# Module #1 - HTML, CSS and GIT (Frontend)

Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! In this module you will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS gives us the power to organize these parts and make it look nice. Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton and CSS the skin and clothing.

The second part of this module will deal with [GIT]()

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Be able to write syntactically correct HTML and CSS
- Understand what is meant by "responsive" web development
- Keep in mind accessibility by developing according to the rules of ARIA
- Explain your code by presenting what you've done
- Know your way around Visual Studio Code
- Feel comfortable working with your browser's inspector

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `Reading materials`: this document contains all the required theory you need to know _**while**_ you're coding. It's meant as both study material and as a reference to understand what you're doing.
2. `Homework`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `Lesson Plans`: this part is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

After your first class you should start off with checking the `reading materials` for that week. At the beginning that would be the [Week 1 Reading](/Week1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After, you can get started with the `homework` for that week.

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!
