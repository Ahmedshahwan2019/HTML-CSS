## Homework HTML/CSS/GIT Week 2

> Create a directory "week2" inside your `HYF-Module-HTMLCSSGIT` directory on GitHub. There should already be a "week1" folder that contains your homework from the last week.

## Todo list

1. GIT exercises
2. Responsive design challenges
3. Code along
4. PROJECT: Responsive website

### 1. GIT exercises

### 2. Responsive design challenges

Making websites that are `responsive` to a variety of device sizes (in other words, that still "look good" on any device), has become the standard way of building. You have to learn how to do this to. However, fear not because it's not as intimating as it might seem; you're not going to build a separete page for literally every device size out there.

Instead, you'll be applying certain CSS rules only to certain device sizes. In the following two mini-courses you'll get some practice in:

-   [Learn Responsive Design](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-responsive-design)
-   [Responsive Web Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-principles/)

### 3. Code along

In the following video you'll be rebuilding a responsive HTML5 website. Put your focus on how the structure of the page is built:

First HTML to provide structure & content, and then CSS. Look at the HTML tags used and the names given to classes.

-   [Build An HTML5 Website With A Responsive Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw)

The second website you're going to build revolves around using flexbox.

### 4. PROJECT: Drones website

https://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk/templates/simplestyle_purple/index.html

-   Grids exercise
    -   Download the HTML and images in the folder Homework 2 ([or click this link to download](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS/tree/master/Week2/homework2))
    -   You are going to write the CSS for this page
    -   **You are not allowed to change the HTML**
    -   The page contains two grids: the first one should work using floats, the second using flex box. Be careful not to mix the two!
    -   We want the grid to look as follows (check the wireframe below):
        -   On mobile phones (smaller than 600px): a two column grid, with the exception that the first item spans the full width
        -   On tablets (between 600px and 1024px): a three column grid, with the exception that the first two items span the full width together (so first we have two columns, then after the first two items we have three columns)
        -   On desktops (1024px and up): a four column grid, with the exception that the first item spans two columns.
    -   There should be some space between the grid items
    -   Make the page look beautiful by adding some more CSS! Some tips:
        -   How about some nice colors, fonts, hover styles?
        -   According to the grid specification, some products are bigger than others. Maybe these are "highlighted" products, so the rest of the styling could also be different.
