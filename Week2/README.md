## 1. Introduction to GIT

### Working with the command line

In order to learn GIT you first have to learn the `command line`!

The Command Line interface (also known as CLI or shell) is a way to navigate through your computer's content (media, folders, applications, etc.) without a visual user interface. It's a program that you can find pre-installed on your computer, but is named differently depending on your operating system:

- For Windows it's called `cmd.exe`
- For MacOS and Linux it's called `Terminal`

It's crucial to get used to working with it. In the following [document](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine/blob/master/Week1/Lecture.md) you'll read about the basic commands you need to know in order to successfully make use of the command line.

Also watch the following videos and code along:

### What is GIT?

GIT is software that allows you to save your work at any given moment in time during your work. It's typically called a `version control system`, which essentially means that it allows you to create `versions` of your workspace and makes possible to switch between older and newer states.

For example, let's say you have a folder with a single file. You can use GIT to make a "snapshot" of the current state of your workspace. This snapshot can be accessed at any given moment and used.

- [GIT Tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4)

### Installing GIT

In order to use GIT you have to first install it. The software is different depending on your operating system:

- For Windows, install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- For MacOS, install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- For Linux, install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

### Basic GIT commands

## 2. Intermediate CSS

By now you've gotten some practice with CSS. In the following sections you'll learn about some more essentials concepts in order to write modern stylesheets for the web!

### Flexible organizing with flexbox

read about [flexbox](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/flexbox/)

### Pseudo class selectors

So far you've learned the following:

- HTML allows you to structure content and media on a webpage
- CSS is used to

### Responsive design with media queries

Nowadays people use different devices to access websites: desktops, tablets and mobiles of all different sizes. Responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width, and prevents visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content.

Most

The primary way of making a responsive website is by writing custom CSS code that makes it so. This can be done using `media queries`: CSS instructions that only apply to certain screen sizes.

Start reading about media queries here: [Introduction to Media Queries](https://varvy.com/mobile/media-queries.html).

## 3. Working with the browser

### What is a web browser?

You probably use it daily. Let's talk a closer look at what it actually is.

A web browser is software that allows you view websites, either retrieved from the internet or loaded from your computer. The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML, transforming all the code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) as well as the references (images, videos, etc.) to render a webpage.

For further study, watch the following:

### Choosing the right browser

As a web developer you will write code that will display in browsers. As such it is important that you get familiar with most major browsers in use today. These are:

- [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) (Not available for Mac/Linux yet)
- [Opera]

In your HackYourFuture journey you'll mainly be using **Google Chrome** when developing, as is has great developer tools that allow us to develop web applications in an easy and clear way.

### How to use the inspector :mag:

The inspector is part of browsers developers can use to take a closer look at the
