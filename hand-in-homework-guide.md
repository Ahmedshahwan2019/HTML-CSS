# How to hand in homework

During the first module you will hand in your homework in two places:

1. [Trello](https://www.trello.com/)
2. [GitHub](https://www.github.com/)

## 1. Trello homework guide

Add a card in Trello:

In Trello, create a card with your name (there is an example in there) and add the link to your CodePen that contains you technical assignment.

## 2. GitHub homework guide

Follow these steps to properly hand in your homework:

1. In your newly created Github account search for the invitation from the HackYourFuture organization to join your classes team.
2. Create a new repository (name it something like hyf-html-css) make sure you select the option: initialize with README.
3. Inside your new repository create a folder called "week1". If you have trouble finding out how to create a folder in Github check this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18773598/creating-folders-inside-github-com-repo-without-using-git)

4. Upload the files you created on your computer (step 3 of the homework) inside this folder, write a description for this “commit” (for example: "homework week1").
5. Your hyf-html-css/week1 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and maybe a folder containing your images)
6. Open the files in your folder to check if all of this worked.
7. Now go to the settings of your repository:![settings overview](./assets/github_pages1.png)
8. And go to _Github Pages_ select "master" instead of "none"![pages overview](./assets/github_pages2.png)
9. Now you can view your homework online at: https://_hereyouplaceyourgithubusername_.github.io/hyf-html-css/week1
10. Finally, add a card with the URL to your homework in Trello.
