# How to hand in homework

During the first module you will hand in your homework in two places:

1. [GitHub](https://www.github.com/)
2. [Trello](https://www.trello.com/)

## 1. GitHub homework guide

Follow these steps to properly hand in your homework:

1. Go to Github and [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) called `HYF-Module-HTMLCSSGIT` (select the option: initialize with README)
2. Inside the new repository create a folder with the name of the appropriate week (ex. `week1`)
3. Upload the the homework files
4. Before submitting the upload, write a message that says something about what you've done. For week1 the message could be: "wrote cli commands and build digital resume"
5. Open the files in your folder to check if all of this worked.
6. Now go to the settings of your repository:![settings overview](./assets/github_pages1.png)
7. And go to _Github Pages_ select "master" instead of "none"![pages overview](./assets/github_pages2.png)
8. Now you can view your homework online at: https://_hereyouplaceyourgithubusername_.github.io/hyf-html-css/week1

> Here is an example of how your homework repository should look: https://github.com/mkruijt/HTML-CSS

## 2. Trello homework guide

Follow these steps to upload the link to your homework:

1. Go to the `Feedback Assignments` board
2. In the right week, create a card with your name and week number (like, `Noer Paanakker Week 1 homework`)
3. Click on the card, and attach the URL of your GitHub repository

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!
