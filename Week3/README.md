## 1. GIT branching

### Local branches

`Branches` are a core benefit of using GIT. It allows you to work on different versions of your project in parallel. Imagine

Working with branches is especially important when working with other developers. This only applies when working with a **remote** repository, which we'll talk about in the next section.

### Working with branches on GitHub

### Making pull requests

A **pull request** is a term GitHub uses to refer to merge requests; a request to incorporate code changes made by a developer (whether it's you or another developer) into the code stored in a branch of a repository.

These changes are proposed in a branch, and the pull request usually is made to merge into the `master` branch. Code changes through pull requests never merge directly into the target branch, unless the administrator uses their rights to do so. In normal circumstances, there has to be at least one other person reviewing the proposal before it is approved to be merged.

Pull requests only happen in remote repositories. This can happen in 2 ways:
(1) A merge request from one branch to another **within the same repository**. For more information on this, read:

-   [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

(2) A merge request from one branch to a branch **from a forked repository into the original repository**. A `fork` is a copy of a repository, that is stored in your personal GitHub account. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.

While both are important to know, it's useful to study the second way because that's how you'll submit your homework:

## 2. CSS Frameworks

In order to explain CSS frameworks, we first must understand what a framework is. Let's explain using an analogy.

Let's suppose you want to make a ginger tea on daily basis. You do this with several ingredients: water, pieces of ginger and sugar. Doing so you will find it is really difficult to put all ingredients in the right proportions all the time.

One morning you come up with idea of mixing all the ingredients in one jar in the correct proportion, such that every spoon will serve the right amount to make the tea.

This jar is your framework. By using it you never have to think about When we want to do lots of things on regular basis it just consumes time and a framework will not only save time it will also provide right components in ur applications. Fast and easy.

### Why use a CSS framework?

A CSS framework allows you to style your HTML reliably, by making use of carefully written CSS rules.
