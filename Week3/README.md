## 1. GIT branching

### Local branches

`Branches` are a core benefit of using GIT. It allows you to work on different versions of your project in parallel. Imagine

Working with branches is especially important when working with other developers. This only applies when working with a **remote** repository, which we'll talk about in the next section.

### Working with branches on GitHub

### Working with a remote repository: GitHub

In practice, having a copy of your code is essential. What if your local files get corrupt, your computer crashes or it's almost impossible to rewrite complex code that just doesn't work? We already learned that GIT can help us with this.

However, we can go a step further: we can have a copy of our code online. For this we use a Git repository hosting service, called **GitHub**.

### Making pull requests

A **pull request** is a term GitHub uses to refer to merge requests; a request to incorporate code changes made by a developer (whether it's you or another developer) into the code stored in a branch of a repository.

## 2. CSS Frameworks

In order to explain CSS frameworks, we first must understand what a framework is. Let's explain using an analogy.

Let's suppose you want to make a ginger tea on daily basis. You do this with several ingredients: water, pieces of ginger and sugar. Doing so you will find it is really difficult to put all ingredients in the right proportions all the time.

One morning you come up with idea of mixing all the ingredients in one jar in the correct proportion, such that every spoon will serve the right amount to make the tea.

This jar is your framework. By using it you never have to think about When we want to do lots of things on regular basis it just consumes time and a framework will not only save time it will also provide right components in ur applications. Fast and easy.

### Why use a CSS framework?

A CSS framework allows you to style your HTML reliably, by making use of carefully written CSS rules.
