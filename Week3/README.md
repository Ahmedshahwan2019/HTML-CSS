### Local branches

`Branches` are a core benefit of using GIT. It allows you to work on different versions of your project in parallel. Imagine

Working with branches is especially important when working with other developers.

### Working with a remote repository: GitHub

In practice, having a copy of your code is essential. What if your local files get corrupt, your computer crashes or it's almost impossible to rewrite complex code that just doesn't work? We already learned that GIT can help us with this.

### Making pull requests

A pull request is a term GitHub uses to refer to merge requests.

### Basic GIT workflow

## 2. CSS Frameworks

Let's suppose you want to make a special tea on daily basis. You do this with several ingredients: water, special tea leaves and sugar. Doing so on a daily basis most of the time you will find it is really difficult to put all ingredients in right ratio all time, u can forget some times u have to open several boxes one by one , one morning u come up with idea of mixing all ingredients in one jar in one ratio , such that every spoon will serve the right ratio mix to the tea.

This jar is your framework. When we want to do lots of things on regular basis it just consumes time and a framework will not only save time it will also provide right components in ur applications. Fast and easy.

### Why use a framework?

A common theme in development you'll learn is: **Don't Repeat Yourself** (DRY).

### Most popular frameworks
