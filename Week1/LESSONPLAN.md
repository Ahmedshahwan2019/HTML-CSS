# Lesson Plan Week 1

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to introduce to the student the most basic HTML/CSS concepts:

-   Difference `<head>` and `<body>`
-   Semantic HTML5
-   The box model
-   Working with the browser

### Core concepts

1. **Difference `<head>` and `<body>`**

-   The `<head>` holds all the page's meta-data: information about the complete webpage

_Show examples of what the `<head>` could hold and why: `<title>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`_

-   The `<body>` holds all the elements that will be displayed in the browser

_Show examples of commonly used HTML tags: `<h1>`, `<a href="#">`, `<>`_

2. **Semantic HTML5**

-   In theory a page can be constructed using only `<div>`s
-   Semantic tags make the code more comprehensible
-   It helps organize the page

_Show examples of semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`_

3. **The box model**

-   Everything is a box
-   The "box" refers to the attributes universal to every element: `margin`, `padding`, border`
-   Every element pushes against one another

_Show example of the box model by using the browser inspector on various elements_

4. **Working with the browser**

-   A browser does 2 main things: connect to the internet and make HTML viewable
-   Developer tools: the inspector
-   DOM explorer and CSS editor

_Show how and why to use the inspector_
