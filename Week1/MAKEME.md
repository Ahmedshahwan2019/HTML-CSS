## Step 1: Read and watch

#### How to learn effectively

#### HTML5

Read about [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

#### CSS:

- [CSS reference](http://cssreference.io/)

## Step 2: Upload your technical assignment to GitHub

_Deadline Monday_

- Please create a repository on Github, call it `hyf-html-css`.
- Inside this repository create a folder `week0`.
- Use the code of the application assignment you have made(in codepen.io), copy and paste the html in a `index.html` file and the css in a `style.css` file and upload it to github in the `week0` folder.
- For better instructions on how to do this please check the [how to hand in homework](#how-to-hand-in-homework) down below.

> Don't forget, you can always revisit Khan Academy: [Into to HTML/CSS: Making web pages](https://nl.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) if you are stuck and need a refresher.

## Step 3: Assignment

_Deadline Saturday_

In the following assignment you'll make your own online resume. Here are the requirements that need to be fulfilled:

- It needs to be one webpage
- Your project folder should contain two files: HTML and CSS
- Include the following pieces of information:
  - Your personal info
  - A picture of you
  - A few lines about who you are
  - Education
  - Work experience
  - _Please do not include your current address, phone number and mail address, your CV will be hosted on Github_

When writing the HTML for your resume keep in mind the following:

- Include:
  - Different types of headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)
  - An unordered list (`<ul>`). In this list include the _learning strategies_ you used while studying. Also include some of the resources/references, this can be documentation/video etc., that were helpful.
  - Another unordered list (`<ul>`). In this list you include the most important platforms/resources where you can find all HackYourFuture related information.
  - an `<img>` tag (for the picture of you)
  - some `<p>` tags
  - Some CSS properties, like: `margin`, `padding`, `color`, etc.
  - Make sure that your page looks nice, and that your text is readable & accessible (ARIA)

**Before** you hand in your assignment, read the [Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) and validate your files (for [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and for [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/))

### How to hand in Homework:

Follow these steps to properly hand in your homework:

1. In your newly created Github account search for the invitation from the HackYourFuture organization to you join your classes team.
2. Create a new repository (name it something like hyf-html-css) make sure you select the option: initialize with README.
3. Inside your new repository create a folder called "week1". If you have trouble finding out how to create a folder in Github check this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18773598/creating-folders-inside-github-com-repo-without-using-git)

   > Tip: you can also create a "week1" folder on your local computer that contains you files and upload the entire folder to Github.

4. Upload the files you created on your computer (step 3 of the homework) inside this folder, write a description for this “commit” (for example: "homework week1").
5. Your hyf-html-css/week1 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and maybe a folder containing your images)
6. Open the files in your folder to check if all of this worked.
7. Now go to the settings of your repository:![settings overview](./assets/github_pages1.png)
8. And go to _Github Pages_ select "master" instead of "none"![pages overview](./assets/github_pages2.png)
9. Now you can view your homework online at: https://_hereyouplaceyourgithubusername_.github.io/hyf-html-css/week1
10. Finally, add a card with the URL to your homework in Trello.

### Here is an example of how your homework repository should look:

- https://github.com/mkruijt/HTML-CSS
